# AES67 Player

The AES67 Player is an application used to play AES67 audio streams on Android devices.

# Introduction

Play your AES67 audio streams directly on your Android devices for testing, previewing or just for fun by using the AES67 Player and the AES67 Linux Daemon.

The AES67 Linux Daemon is an open source Linux application and you can find it at: [AES67 Linux Daemon](https://github.com/bondagit/aes67-linux-daemon)

Starting from version 2.0 the daemon is able to capture and compress, using the AAC codec, AES67 sinks and serve them via HTTP Live Streaming supporting scalable audio distribution.

The Player is able to playback the live streams up to 8 channels each. 

The diagram below shows the various components and how they interact:

# Setup instruction

To use the Player follow these instructions:

1. Install and configure the AES67 Linux daemon v2.0 or above on a Linux host and attach it to your AES67 LAN, see [How to build and setup the daemon](https://github.com/bondagit/aes67-linux-daemon?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-build-and-setup-the-daemon).
2. Using the AES67 Linux daemon WebUI, in the Config tab, check the daemon version and enable the Streamer feature.

3. Attach one or more AES67 or Dante Sources to your LAN. See [Compatible Device](https://github.com/bondagit/aes67-linux-daemon/blob/master/DEVICES.md)
4. Using the AES67 Linux daemon WebUI, in the Sinks tab, create one of more Sinks specifying the AES67 Sources discovered by the daemon.
